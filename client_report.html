    <h2>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</h2>
    <p>I used colors that work together and fit my idea. For the images, I used images that related to the albums I talked about</p>
    <lb></lb>
    <h2>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</h2>
    <p>I communicated by email and in person in-class. I didn't have any major issues with communication.</p>
    <lb></lb>
    <h2>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</h2>
    <p>For the most part. He didn't ask many questions.</p>
    <lb></lb>
    <h2>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</h2>
    <p>I will probably make a groupchat to communicate more often with the main developer. I will also reach out more and not wait for him to start the contacting.</p>
    <lb></lb>
    <h2>How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for your junior devs?</h2>
    <p>I made the assignments on the GitHub repository, created the different html files so it would be easier for the junior developers to start working on them. Most of the communication was done by email, but some of it was done in class.</p>
    <lb></lb>
    <h2>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?</h2>
    <p>I communicated with him all in person, which was good because I was able to ask questions for clarification while I was working on the website. There wasn't any issues.</p>
    <lb></lb>
    <h2>How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?</h2>
    <p>I shared the URL with the client and always made sure to publish the edits I made as soon as I was done working in them.</p>
    <lb></lb>
    <h2>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</h2>
    <p>I liked it a lot. It made things much easier and it was pretty easy to work with. We didn't have any issues coordinating our changes as well.</p>
    <lb></lb>
    <h2>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?</h2>
    <p>I mainly communicated in person, it was very easy. Didn't have any issues.</p>
    <lb></lb>
    <h2>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</h2>
    <p>For one of them, yes. For the other, the lead developer didn't communicate very well, so I had to figure it out on my own.</p>
    <lb></lb>
    <h2>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</h2>
    <p>Yes.</p>
    <lb></lb>
    <h2>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</h2>
    <p>No.</p>
    <h2>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</h2>
    <p>The most challenging part was making sure the website I did as a lead developer was matching the wireframe, which required asking the client a few questions. I was able to overcome that by communicating and being proactive.</p>
    <lb></lb>
    <h2>What did you enjoy most about this project?</h2>
    <p>What I enjoyed the most was how it replicated a real world scenario and gave me an opportunity to experience all the roles in the development of a website. I also practiced communicating and being a team player. It was a really fun experience.</p>
    <lb></lb>
    <h2>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</h2>
    <p>I would start doing my junior developer roles sooner, that would have allowed me more time to communicate with my lead developer.</p>
    <lb></lb>
    <h2>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</h2>
    <p>I feel more confident. After this project I was able to get a taste of how it would be to work in a team environment, solve problems, communicate, and be an effective part of a team. It was also good practice to have different roles in different websites. The experience of starting with the wireframe and ending with the finished website was very cool. I really enjoyed going through the whole process.</p>
